# Entities

# 4. Creating our first Entity

In the overview chapter, we took a look at the `TaskItem` structure:

```swift
/// A representation of a task.
struct TaskItem {

	/// The title of the task.
	let title: String

	/// An optional subtitle associated with the task.
	let subtitle: String?

	/// Specifies whether the task is completed or not.
	let isCompleted: Bool
}
```

In order to persist this data, we must create a Core Data entity with the same properties. Start by tapping the `Add Entity` button at the bottom of the screen:

![Group 25.png](11.4-first-entity/Group_25.png)

This will create a new entity, which will be visible on the left side of the model editor. I like to differentiate between `TaskItem` and my Core Data entity by adding a ‚Äú*Stored‚Äù* prefix - `StoredTaskItem`.

With our entity created, let‚Äôs add the necessary attributes.

![Group 27.png](11.4-first-entity/Group_27.png)

We created the same attributes as our structure and assigned to appropriate type:

- `isCompleted`: a property of type `Boolean`;
- `subtitle`: a property of type `String`;
- `title`: a property of type `String`;

Finally, since we know that `title` and `isCompleted` are both required properties, we should uncheck the `Optional` property from both:

Note that Core Data‚Äôs `Optional` and Swift optionals are completely different things. Core Data is a technology way older than Swift. Basically, the way optionals in Core Data work is that if you try to save an entity without first setting all the non-optional properties, the save will fail and an exception will be thrown.

With this in mind, our basic entity structure is done. Our next step is to initialize Core Data and use our newly created entity in code.
