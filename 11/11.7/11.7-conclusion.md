# Conclusion

This should be enough to get us started - we learned how to create entities in the Core Data model, how to initialize our persistence service, how to save and fetch data, as well as how to sort and filter our results.

To be fair, we barely scratched the surface with this technology. There are a lot of features and intricacies that we haven’t discussed, but for now, it should be enough to get us started on our Core Data journey.

Hopefully, you now have the skills needed to integrate Core Data into your own project. Take it one step at a time, and if you’re interested in more details, feel free to check the official Core Data documentation for a deeper understanding.
