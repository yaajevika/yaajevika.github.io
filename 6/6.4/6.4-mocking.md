# Mocking

Up until this point, we looked at very simple, “*idealized*” components. Even our `LoginViewModel` that we used as an example is greatly simplified. In reality, no login functionality can work without a Networking service dependency.

Real life application components are highly interconnected with each other. View Models depend on a bunch of services to handle the business logic, and each service might in turn depend on several other services to do their job.

With this in mind, let’s increase the complexity of our `LoginViewModel` slightly, by adding more functionality:

```swift
@Observable
final class LoginViewModel: LoginViewModelProtocol {

    // MARK: - Dependencies

    private let authenticationService = AuthenticationService()

    // MARK: - Properties

    var email: String = ""
    var password: String = ""
    var token: String?
    var error: Error?

    // MARK: - Getters

    var isEmailValid: Bool {
        email.contains("@") &&
        email.contains(".") &&
        email.count <= 64 &&
        email.isMatchingRegex("^[A-Za-z0-9]")
    }

    var isPasswordValid: Bool {
        password.count > 8
    }

    var isLoginButtonEnabled: Bool {
        isEmailValid && isPasswordValid
    }

    // MARK: - Events

    func onLogin() async {
        do {
            let token = try await authenticationService.login(
                email: email,
                password: password
            )

            onSuccess(with: token)
        } catch {
            onFailure(with: error)
        }
    }

    // MARK: - Helpers

    private func onSuccess(with token: String) {
        self.token = token
    }

    private func onFailure(with error: Error) {
        self.error = error
    }
}
```

In this new version, our `LoginViewModel` also has a method called `onLogin`, which allows used to perform an authentication when they tap on the “*Login*” button on the UI. As a result, our view model now depends on an `AuthenticationService` for its authentication logic.

And this is where our problem starts. One of the main principles of unit testing is **isolation** - meaning that each component of our application must be tested independently, without accessing other parts of the application.

Since our view model has a direct connection with `AuthenticationService`, it is impossible to test the `onLogin` method without touching the `AuthenticationService` logic as well. Why is this an issue?  Our authentication service perform API requests, which means that if the backend is down, our unit tests will fail as well.

As you can imagine, this is not great. We care about testing our view model logic, and only that. We don’t care about anything else outside of this scope. So if our tests fail because of an external factor, they aren’t working as expected. This also ties into a different principle of unit testing, which is **reliability**. If I run the test 100 times, I should always expect the same result. As you can imagine, this is hard to do when you can’t control the external dependencies of your component.

This is where **protocols** and **dependency injection** come into place. Our goal is to ensure that when writing unit tests, we don’t access the “real” authentication implementation, but rather a fake, *mocked* implementation.

---

# Adding Dependency Injection

First of all, let’s add dependency injection. The purpose of dependency injection is that instead of hardcoding our dependencies directly inside of our components, we pass them via initializers. This will allow us to pass different versions of our authentication service when we initialize our SUT for testing.

Basically, instead of our current implementation:

```swift
@Observable
final class LoginViewModel: LoginViewModelProtocol {

    // MARK: - Dependencies

    private let authenticationService = AuthenticationService()

    // ...
}
```

We change it as such:

```swift
@Observable
final class LoginViewModel: LoginViewModelProtocol {

    // MARK: - Dependencies

    private let authenticationService: AuthenticationService

    // MARK: - Initializers

    init(authenticationService: AuthenticationService) {
	    self.authenticationService = authentication
    }
}
```

# Adding Protocols

Even though we improved our code by adding dependency injection, our `LoginViewModel` still only accepts an `AuthenticationService` implementation, which relies on real API calls. What we need to do is allow `LoginViewModel` to accept *any* authentication service, as long as it has the required login method.

This is where protocols come in. Protocols act as a contract - they specify *what* something does, but now *how* it does it. If our `LoginViewModel` depends on an protocol instead of a concrete implementation, we basically say that our view model will accept any class or struct as long as it adopts the `AuthenticationServiceProtocol`.

In other words, as long as we have the required `login` method, we don’t care who implements the protocol and what is passed as a parameter in the `LoginViewModel` initializer.

In conclusion, by replacing our implementation with a protocol, we can easily create an `AuthenticationServiceMock` with our custom behaviour, and replace it in our unit tests.

Let’s start by defining our protocol:

```swift
import Foundation

protocol AuthenticationServiceProtocol {
    func login(email: String, password: String) async throws -> String
}
```

Then, let’s make our `AuthenticationServiceImplementation` adopt the protocol:

```swift
import Foundation

final class AuthenticationService: AuthenticationServiceProtocol {

    // MARK: - Dependencies

    private let apiService: APIServiceProtocol

    // MARK: - Initializers

    init(apiService: APIServiceProtocol) {
	    self.apiService = apiService
    }

    // MARK: - Protocol Conformance

    func login(email: String, password: String) async throws -> String {
			  let request = LoginRequest(email: email, password: password)
		    return try await apiService.send(request)
    }
}
```

Finally, in our view model, let’s replace the implementation with the protocol definition:

```swift
@Observable
final class LoginViewModel: LoginViewModelProtocol {

    // MARK: - Dependencies

    private let authenticationService: AuthenticationServiceProtocol

    // MARK: - Initializers

    init(authenticationService: AuthenticationServiceProtocol) {
		    self.authenticationService = authenticationService
	  }

    // MARK: - Properties

    var email: String = ""
    var password: String = ""
    var token: String?
    var error: Error?

    // MARK: - Getters

    var isEmailValid: Bool {
        email.contains("@") &&
        email.contains(".") &&
        email.count <= 64 &&
        email.isMatchingRegex("^[A-Za-z0-9]")
    }

    var isPasswordValid: Bool {
        password.count > 8
    }

    var isLoginButtonEnabled: Bool {
        isEmailValid && isPasswordValid
    }

    // MARK: - Events

    func onLogin() async {
        do {
            let token = try await authenticationService.login(
                email: email,
                password: password
            )

            onSuccess(with: token)
        } catch {
            onFailure(with: error)
        }
    }

    // MARK: - Helpers

    private func onSuccess(with token: String) {
        self.token = token
    }

    private func onFailure(with error: Error) {
        self.error = error
    }
}
```

With this, our implementation is done. Now, in our test target - we can create a *mocked* authentication service implementation that does not rely on a real API service. This mocked implementation will return fake responses, depending on our test requirements:

```swift
import Foundation

final class AuthenticationServiceMock: AuthenticationServiceProtocol {

    var loginTask: Task<Result<String, AuthenticationServiceError>, Never> = Task {
        .failure(.requestFailed)
    }

    func login(email: String, password: String) async throws -> String {
        try await loginTask.value.get()
    }
}
```

This mocked implementation allows us to set the expected return value for our `login` method - either a `.success(String)` or a `.failure(AuthenticationServiceError)`, which we can use to simulate a successful or failed API response.

Finally, let’s update our tests:

```swift
import XCTest

@testable import CreativityHub

final class LoginViewModelTests: XCTestCase {

    // MARK: - Properties

    private var authenticationService: AuthenticationServiceMock!
    private var sut: LoginViewModel!

    // MARK: - Test Setup

    override func setUp() async throws {
        try await super.setUp()
        authenticationService = AuthenticationServiceMock()
        sut = await LoginViewModel(authenticationService: authenticationService)
    }

    override func tearDown() async throws {
        authenticationService = nil
        sut = nil
        try await super.tearDown()
    }

    // MARK: - Test Cases

    @MainActor
    func test_givenSuccessfulResponse_whenOnLogin_thenReturnAccessToken() async {

        // Given

        authenticationService.loginTask = Task {
            .success("ACCESS_TOKEN")
        }

        // When

        await sut.onLogin()

        // Then

        XCTAssertEqual(sut.token, "ACCESS_TOKEN")
    }

    @MainActor
    func test_givenFailedResponse_whenOnLogin_thenThrowException() async {

        // Given

        authenticationService.loginTask = Task {
            .failure(.requestFailed)
        }

        // When

        await sut.onLogin()

        // Then

        XCTAssertEqual(sut.error as? AuthenticationServiceError, .requestFailed)
    }
}
```
