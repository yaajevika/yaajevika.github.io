# Conclusion

At this point, we have covered a lot of the basics of unit testing. Hopefully, you found this guide useful and are able to jump in to writing unit tests for your own code.

I hope that I have managed to succeed in convincing you that unit testing is probably one of the most important aspects of software development, as it has the most impact on the quality of the code you write and how you think and plan your app architecture along the way.

Good quality code is code that is *testable*. If you manage to write thorough unit tests for all aspects of your software, then you can be confident that your code is written well. Make sure to always apply *protocols* and *dependency injection* in your code and to make sure that whenever you develop a new functionality for your app, it is covered with the appropriate unit tests.
