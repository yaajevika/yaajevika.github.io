# Introduction to Unit Tests
Software development is constantly evolving. As applications grow, new features are added, requirements change, and some features may be modified or even removed. To ensure our application continues to function as expected, we must maintain a robust testing strategy regardless of codebase changes.

As mobile developers, we have various testing strategies to validate different aspects of our application. The most common methodologies include:

- **UI Testing** - automating UI interactions to verify that user interactions behave as expected.
- **Snapshot Testing** - capturing and comparing UI screenshots to detect unintended visual changes.
- **Integration Testing** - testing communication between components (e.g., `ViewModel` and `APIService`) to ensure they work together correctly.
- **Unit Testing** - testing individual methods and components in isolation to confirm they function as intended.

A well-rounded test suite combines multiple strategies to provide confidence in our code. However, due to deadlines and resource constraints, teams often prioritize certain types of tests.

The most common testing strategy used by teams is **unit testing**. This is because unit testing tackles the application's business logic. Although UI bugs are annoying, they are not as critical as the application logic itself.

Among these, **unit testing** is the most widely used strategy because it validates the applicationâ€™s core business logic. While UI bugs can be frustrating, they are typically less critical than issues affecting fundamental application behavior.
