# Navigation

## What is Navigation in iOS Apps?

Navigation in iOS applications refers to the system of moving users between different screens and content areas within your app. It's essentially how users traverse your application's interface, allowing them to access different features and content.

In iOS, navigation is more than just moving from one screen to another—it's a core part of the user experience that:

- Establishes a visual hierarchy of content
- Provides context about where users are in your app
- Creates a logical flow between related tasks and information
- Helps users understand how to get back to previous screens
- Maintains user state and data across different parts of the application

iOS provides several built-in navigation patterns and components that iOS users are familiar with, including:

- **Stack-based navigation**: Using UINavigationController to push and pop view controllers
- **Modal presentations**: Presenting view controllers modally for focused tasks
- **Tab-based navigation**: Using UITabBarController to switch between major app sections
- **Page-based navigation**: Swiping horizontally between related content
- **Container view controllers**: Custom navigation patterns with container view controllers

## Why Proper Navigation Architecture Matters

Implementing a well-structured navigation system is crucial for several reasons:

### 1. Maintainability

- **Separation of concerns**: Good navigation architecture separates navigation logic from view controller logic, making your codebase more modular
- **Reduced coupling**: View controllers shouldn't know about each other directly, reducing dependencies
- **Easier refactoring**: When navigation logic is centralized, changing navigation flows doesn't require modifying multiple view controllers
- **Scalability**: As your app grows, proper navigation architecture makes it easier to add new screens without breaking existing flows

### 2. Code Reusability

- **Reuse view controllers**: When view controllers don't contain navigation logic, they can be more easily reused in different contexts
- **Shared transitions**: Navigation patterns can be standardized across the app
- **Common navigation behaviors**: Error handling, authentication flows, and other navigation behaviors can be implemented once and reused

### 3. Testability

- **Unit testing**: Isolated navigation logic can be tested independently from UI
- **Mock navigation**: Navigation dependencies can be mocked for testing view controllers
- **User flow validation**: Complete user journeys can be tested more easily

### 4. User Experience Consistency

- **Predictable behavior**: Users learn how navigation works in your app and expect consistency
- **Animation consistency**: Standard transitions between screens create a polished experience
- **State preservation**: Proper navigation architecture helps preserve app state during navigation
- **Accessibility**: Well-implemented navigation systems work better with VoiceOver and other accessibility features

### 5. Adaptability to Platform Changes

- **Easier to adapt**: When Apple introduces new navigation paradigms or components, a well-architected app is easier to update
- **Device compatibility**: Navigation that works well across iPhone, iPad, and potentially Mac with Catalyst

# UIKit Navigation Approaches

## 1. Segues and Storyboards

Storyboards provide a visual way to design your app's user interface and define the transitions (segues) between view controllers.

### How It Works

1. You create view controllers in a storyboard and define their properties
2. You connect view controllers with segues to establish navigation paths
3. Segues can be triggered by user actions (like button taps) or programmatically

### Types of Segues

- **Show (Push)**: Pushes a view controller onto a navigation stack
- **Present Modally**: Presents a view controller modally
- **Present as Popover**: Presents content in a popover
- **Custom**: Define your own transition animations

### Code Example

```swift
// Triggering a segue programmatically
@IBAction func buttonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    performSegue(withIdentifier: "showDetailSegue", sender: self)
}

// Preparing for a segue
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    if segue.identifier == "showDetailSegue" {
        if let destinationVC = segue.destination as? DetailViewController {
            destinationVC.itemId = selectedItemId
        }
    }
}
```

### Visual Representation

```
┌────────────────┐     showDetailSegue     ┌────────────────┐
│                │ ───────────────────────>│                │
│  MainScreen    │                         │  DetailScreen  │
│                │ <───────────────────────│                │
└────────────────┘                         └────────────────┘
```

### Pros

- ✅ Visual design of navigation flows
- ✅ Quick to implement for simple apps
- ✅ No need to write code for basic transitions
- ✅ Preview of UI without running the app
- ✅ Interface Builder automates constraint setup

### Cons

- ❌ Difficult to manage in team environments (merge conflicts)
- ❌ Limited flexibility for complex navigation scenarios
- ❌ Can lead to Massive View Controllers
- ❌ Segue identifiers are stringly-typed (prone to typos)
- ❌ Difficult to test programmatically
- ❌ View controllers become tightly coupled

## 2. Programmatic Navigation (Push/Present)

Programmatic navigation involves writing code to explicitly push, present, or dismiss view controllers.

### How It Works

1. Create and configure view controller instances in code
2. Use UINavigationController methods to push/pop or use present/dismiss directly
3. Handle view controller transitions manually

A UINavigationController is a fundamental container view controller in UIKit that manages a stack of view controllers in a navigation hierarchy. Here's an explanation of what it is and why it's used:

A UINavigationController is a container view controller that:

1. **Manages a stack of view controllers** - It maintains an ordered array of view controllers (the navigation stack)
2. **Provides a navigation bar** - The bar at the top of the screen shows the current view controller's title and navigation controls (like back buttons)
3. **Handles navigation transitions** - It manages the animations and transitions when moving between screens in the stack
4. **Maintains navigation history** - It keeps track of the user's path through your app's interface

### Code Example

```swift
// Push navigation example
func navigateToDetail(withId id: String) {
    let detailVC = DetailViewController()
    detailVC.itemId = id
    navigationController?.pushViewController(detailVC, animated: true)
}

// Modal presentation example
func presentSettings() {
    let settingsVC = SettingsViewController()
    settingsVC.delegate = self
    settingsVC.modalPresentationStyle = .formSheet
    present(settingsVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

// Dismissing a modal
@IBAction func dismissButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}

// Popping from navigation stack
@IBAction func backButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true)
}
```

### Visual Representation

Navigation Stack:
```text
┌────────────────┐     push     ┌────────────────┐
│                │ ───────────> │                │
│  MainScreen    │              │  DetailScreen  │
│                │ <─────────── │                │
└────────────────┘     pop      └────────────────┘

Modal Presentation:

┌────────────────┐   present    ┌────────────────┐
│                │ ───────────> │                │
│  MainScreen    │              │  SettingsVC    │
│                │ <─────────── │                │
└────────────────┘   dismiss    └────────────────┘
```

### Pros

- ✅ Complete control over the navigation flow
- ✅ Better for complex navigation requirements
- ✅ Easier to manage in source control (less merge conflicts)
- ✅ Better testability
- ✅ No string identifiers

### Cons

- ❌ More code to write
- ❌ View controllers still know about each other
- ❌ Navigation logic mixed with view controller logic
- ❌ Less visual feedback during development
- ❌ Still can lead to tight coupling between screens

## 3. Tab-Based Navigation

Tab-based navigation uses a UITabBarController to switch between distinct sections of your app.

### How It Works

1. Create a UITabBarController as the root of your app
2. Configure multiple view controllers as tabs
3. Each tab can have its own navigation stack

### Code Example

```swift
func setupTabBarController() {
    let tabBarController = UITabBarController()

    // Create first tab - Home with its navigation controller
    let homeVC = HomeViewController()
    homeVC.tabBarItem = UITabBarItem(
        title: "Home",
        image: UIImage(systemName: "house"),
        selectedImage: UIImage(systemName: "house.fill")
    )
    let homeNavController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: homeVC)

    // Create second tab - Profile with its navigation controller
    let profileVC = ProfileViewController()
    profileVC.tabBarItem = UITabBarItem(
        title: "Profile",
        image: UIImage(systemName: "person"),
        selectedImage: UIImage(systemName: "person.fill")
    )
    let profileNavController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: profileVC)

    // Set view controllers for tab bar controller
    tabBarController.viewControllers = [homeNavController, profileNavController]

    // Set as root view controller
    window?.rootViewController = tabBarController
}
```

### Visual Representation
```text
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   UITabBarController    │
└─────────────────────────┘
      /             \
     /               \
    /                 \
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│ Home Nav Stack  │      │ Profile Nav Stack│
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
|                       |
▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│    HomeVC       │      │    ProfileVC    │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
│
▼
┌─────────────────┐
│    DetailVC     │
└─────────────────┘

[   Home   |   Profile   ]  <- Tab Bar
```

### Pros

- ✅ Easy access to key app sections
- ✅ Follows iOS design patterns that users understand
- ✅ Each tab can maintain its own navigation state
- ✅ Good for apps with distinct functional areas
- ✅ Built-in support in UIKit

### Cons

- ❌ Limited to bottom-of-screen navigation
- ❌ Best practice limits tabs to 5 or fewer
- ❌ Not suitable for sequential or hierarchical workflows
- ❌ Can be challenging to navigate between tabs while preserving state
- ❌ Not suitable for all types of applications

## 4. Container View Controllers

Container view controllers manage and display content from other view controllers, allowing for custom navigation patterns.

### How It Works

1. Create a custom container view controller
2. Add child view controllers to display their content
3. Manage transitions between children

### Code Example

```swift
class ContainerViewController: UIViewController {
    private var currentViewController: UIViewController?

    func displayViewController(_ viewController: UIViewController) {
        // Remove current view controller if it exists
        if let currentVC = currentViewController {
            currentVC.willMove(toParent: nil)
            currentVC.view.removeFromSuperview()
            currentVC.removeFromParent()
        }

        // Add new view controller
        addChild(viewController)
        view.addSubview(viewController.view)

        // Configure view controller's view
        viewController.view.frame = view.bounds
        viewController.view.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]

        // Complete the transition
        viewController.didMove(toParent: self)
        currentViewController = viewController
    }

    func transitionToViewController(_ viewController: UIViewController, duration: TimeInterval = 0.3) {
        // Start transition
        let previousVC = currentViewController
        addChild(viewController)

        // Set up new view for animation
        viewController.view.frame = view.bounds
        viewController.view.alpha = 0
        view.addSubview(viewController.view)

        // Animate transition
        UIView.animate(withDuration: duration, animations: {
            viewController.view.alpha = 1
            previousVC?.view.alpha = 0
        }, completion: { _ in
            // Clean up previous view controller
            previousVC?.willMove(toParent: nil)
            previousVC?.view.removeFromSuperview()
            previousVC?.removeFromParent()

            // Complete transition
            viewController.didMove(toParent: self)
            self.currentViewController = viewController
        })
    }
}

// Usage example
let containerVC = ContainerViewController()
let homeVC = HomeViewController()
containerVC.displayViewController(homeVC)

// Later transition to a different view controller
let detailVC = DetailViewController()
containerVC.transitionToViewController(detailVC)
```
### Visual Representation

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Container View Controller         │
│                                    │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Child View Controller      │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────┘   │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Pros

- ✅ Complete control over transitions and animations
- ✅ Can create custom navigation patterns not possible with standard components
- ✅ Good for complex UI with dynamic content areas
- ✅ Can maintain multiple active view controllers
- ✅ Allows for unique and app-specific navigation experiences

### Cons

- ❌ More complex to implement
- ❌ Requires careful memory management
- ❌ Need to handle view controller lifecycle events manually
- ❌ More prone to bugs if child controllers aren't properly added/removed
- ❌ Can lead to more complex architecture without careful planning

# The Coordinator Pattern in iOS

## Origin and Purpose

The Coordinator pattern was introduced to the iOS community by Soroush Khanlou in his 2015 talk at NSSpain titled "Coordinators Redux." The pattern addresses a fundamental challenge in iOS development: managing navigation and flow logic between view controllers.

## The Purpose

Before Coordinators, iOS developers typically handled navigation in one of two ways:

1. **View controllers managing their own navigation**, creating and presenting other view controllers directly
2. **Using storyboards and segues** to define navigation paths visually

Both approaches had significant drawbacks, particularly as apps grew in complexity:

- View controllers became bloated with navigation logic
- Screens became tightly coupled, making reuse difficult
- Navigation flows were hard to change without major refactoring
- Testing navigation logic in isolation was nearly impossible

The core purpose of the Coordinator pattern is to **extract navigation and flow logic out of view controllers** into dedicated objects called Coordinators. These Coordinators are responsible for:

- Creating and configuring view controllers
- Determining when and how to transition between view controllers
- Managing the flow of information between view controllers
- Encapsulating a logical unit of the app's functionality (like user onboarding or checkout flow)

By doing this, view controllers can focus solely on their primary responsibility: managing views and user interactions within a single screen.

## Benefits of the Coordinator Pattern

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **View controllers focus on view logic**: They manage their UI components, handle user input, and display data, without worrying about app-level navigation
- **Coordinators focus on navigation logic**: They handle the transitions between screens and the flow of the application
- **Clear single responsibility**: Each component in the system has a well-defined role
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Developers can reason about individual screens without understanding the entire flow

### 2. Improved Testability

- **Isolated view controllers**: Can be tested in isolation without mocking complex navigation
- **Testable navigation logic**: Coordinators can be tested separately to verify correct flow
- **Easily mocked dependencies**: View controllers can be provided with mock coordinators during testing
- **Flow verification**: Entire user journeys can be tested by asserting coordinator behavior

### 3. Enhanced Reusability

- **Decoupled view controllers**: Can be reused in different contexts and flows
- **Modular flows**: Entire user journeys can be packaged as reusable coordinator modules
- **Composable navigation**: Coordinators can be combined and nested for complex flows
- **Adaptable to different entry points**: Same screens can be used in different sequences

### 4. More Maintainable Codebase

- **Centralized navigation logic**: Changes to app flow require modifications in one place
- **Easier to understand architecture**: Clear separation between UI and navigation
- **Scalable approach**: Works well for both small and complex applications
- **Future-proofing**: Easier to adapt to new iOS navigation paradigms

## Basic Implementation with Unsplash App Example

Let's examine a real-world implementation of the Coordinator pattern using the Unsplash app example. This implementation demonstrates how coordinators manage different flows within the application.

## UINavigationController in the Coordinator Pattern

In the Coordinator pattern, the UINavigationController is particularly important because:

1. **Navigation Control** - The coordinator needs direct access to a navigation controller to push and pop view controllers
2. **Centralized Navigation Management** - By injecting the navigation controller into the coordinator, we give the coordinator full control over navigation
3. **Separation of Concerns** - View controllers don't need to know about the navigation controller; they just tell the coordinator what the user wants to do.

### 1. Main Coordinator Structure

The MainCoordinator serves as the entry point of the application's coordination system:

```swift
final class MainCoordinator {
    let navigationController: UINavigationController
    let authenticationCoordinator: AuthenticationCoordinator
    let browseCoordinator: BrowseCoordinator

    init(_ navigationController: UINavigationController) {
        self.navigationController = navigationController
        self.browseCoordinator = BrowseCoordinator()
        self.authenticationCoordinator = AuthenticationCoordinator(navigationController)
        self.authenticationCoordinator.delegate = self

        let rootViewController = authenticationCoordinator.rootViewController()
        navigationController.setViewControllers([rootViewController], animated: false)
    }
}
```

**Key implementation points:**

- The MainCoordinator manages two sub-coordinators: AuthenticationCoordinator and BrowseCoordinator
- Each coordinator handles a specific functional area of the app
- The MainCoordinator sets up the initial navigation stack with the authentication flow

### 2. Coordinator Communication with Delegates

Coordinators communicate with each other using delegate protocols. When authentication succeeds, the MainCoordinator responds by showing the browse flow:

```swift
extension MainCoordinator: AuthenticationCoordinatorDelegate {
    func userDidSuccessfullyAuthenticate() {
        let viewController = browseCoordinator.rootViewController()
        viewController.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
        browseCoordinator.delegate = self

        navigationController.present(viewController, animated: true)
    }
}

extension MainCoordinator: BrowseCoordinatorDelegate {
    func userDidLogOut() {
        navigationController.popToRootViewController(animated: false)
    }
}
```

**Key implementation points:**

- The MainCoordinator implements delegate methods from both sub-coordinators
- When a user authenticates, the MainCoordinator presents the browse experience
- When a user logs out, the MainCoordinator returns to the authentication flow
- This demonstrates how coordinators handle transitions between major application flows

### 3. Flow-Specific Coordinators

The AuthenticationCoordinator manages all navigation within the authentication flow:

```swift
final class AuthenticationCoordinator {
    weak var delegate: AuthenticationCoordinatorDelegate?
    private var navigationController: UINavigationController

    init(_ navigationController: UINavigationController) {
        self.navigationController = navigationController
    }

    func rootViewController() -> UIViewController {
        let authentication = WelcomeViewFactory.create()
        authentication.delegate = self
        return authentication
    }
}

extension AuthenticationCoordinator: WelcomeViewDelegate {
    func navigateToLogIn() {
        let viewController = LogInViewFactory.create()
        viewController.delegate = self
        navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
    }

    func navigateToCreateAccount() {
        let viewController = CreateAccountViewFactory.create()
        viewController.delegate = self
        navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
    }

    func navigateToBrowse() {
        delegate?.userDidSuccessfullyAuthenticate()
    }
}
```

**Key implementation points:**

- The coordinator provides a rootViewController() method that returns the first screen in the flow
- It handles navigation to different parts of the authentication flow (login, create account)
- The coordinator uses factory methods to create view controllers, which is a clean separation of responsibilities
- When authentication is complete, it notifies its delegate (the MainCoordinator) instead of handling that navigation itself

### 4. Navigation Within a Flow

The AuthenticationCoordinator also manages sub-flows within authentication:

```swift
extension AuthenticationCoordinator: LogInViewDelegate {
    func navigateToForgotPassword() {
        let viewController = ForgotPasswordViewFactory.create()
        viewController.delegate = self
        navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
    }

    func userDidLogInSuccessfully() {
        delegate?.userDidSuccessfullyAuthenticate()
    }
}

extension AuthenticationCoordinator: ForgotPasswordViewDelegate {
    func navigateBackToLogIn() {
        if let viewController = navigationController.viewControllers.first(where: {
            $0.isKind(of: LogInViewController.self)
        }) {
            navigationController.popToViewController(viewController, animated: true)
        } else {
            navigationController.popToRootViewController(animated: true)
        }
    }
}
```

**Key implementation points:**

- The coordinator implements delegate methods from various view controllers
- It handles both forward navigation (to forgot password) and backward navigation (back to login)
- The coordinator demonstrates advanced navigation techniques (finding a specific view controller in the stack)
- All navigation decisions remain inside the coordinator, not the view controllers

### 5. Complex UI Structures with Coordinators

The BrowseCoordinator demonstrates how to handle more complex UI structures like tab bar controllers:

```swift
final class BrowseCoordinator {
    weak var delegate: BrowseCoordinatorDelegate?

    func rootViewController() -> UIViewController {
        // Browse
        let browse = BrowseViewFactory.create()
        browse.delegate = self
        let browseNavViewController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: browse)

        // Likes
        let likes = LikesFactory.create()
        likes.delegate = self
        let likesNavViewController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: likes)

        // Settings
        let settings = SettingsFactory.create()
        settings.delegate = self
        let settingsNavViewController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: settings)

        let tabbar = UITabBarController()
        tabbar.setViewControllers([browseNavViewController, likesNavViewController, settingsNavViewController], animated: true)
        return tabbar
    }
}
```

**Key implementation points:**

- The coordinator creates and configures multiple view controllers for a tab bar interface
- Each tab has its own navigation controller, allowing for independent navigation stacks
- The coordinator sets itself as the delegate for all the root view controllers
- This demonstrates how coordinators can manage complex UI hierarchies while keeping navigation logic centralized

### 6. Handling Different Types of Navigation

The BrowseCoordinator handles different navigation scenarios within its flow:

```swift
extension BrowseCoordinator: BrowseViewDelegate {
    func openPictureDetails(picture: PictureModel, _ navigationController: UINavigationController) {
        let pictureDetails = PictureDetailsFactory.create(picture: picture)
        pictureDetails.delegate = self
        pictureDetails.hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = true
        navigationController.pushViewController(pictureDetails, animated: true)
    }
}

extension BrowseCoordinator: SettingsViewDelegate {
    func navigateToChangePassword(navigationController: UINavigationController) {
        let changePassword = ChangePasswordFactory.create()
        changePassword.delegate = self
        navigationController.pushViewController(changePassword, animated: true)
    }

    func userDidLogOut() {
        delegate?.userDidLogOut()
    }
}
```

**Key implementation points:**

- The coordinator accepts a navigationController parameter, allowing it to handle navigation within any tab
- It manages UI-specific properties like hidesBottomBarWhenPushed
- When the user logs out, it delegates the action to its parent coordinator rather than handling it directly
- This shows how coordinators can manage navigation both within and between flows

## Hierarchical Coordinator Architecture

The Unsplash app example demonstrates a hierarchical coordinator architecture:

1. **MainCoordinator**: Top-level coordinator that manages app-wide navigation flows
2. **AuthenticationCoordinator**: Manages the authentication flow (welcome, login, signup, forgot password)
3. **BrowseCoordinator**: Manages the main app experience after authentication (browse, likes, settings)

This hierarchical structure offers several benefits:

- **Modularity**: Each coordinator manages a specific section of the app
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each coordinator knows exactly what part of the navigation it handles
- **Independent development**: Different team members can work on different flows
- **Easier maintenance**: Changes to one flow don't affect other flows

## Implementing Coordinator Communication

The Unsplash example demonstrates communication between coordinators using delegation:

```swift
protocol AuthenticationCoordinatorDelegate: AnyObject {
    func userDidSuccessfullyAuthenticate()
}

protocol BrowseCoordinatorDelegate: AnyObject {
    func userDidLogOut()
}
```

This delegate-based communication:

- Creates a clear contract between coordinators
- Maintains loose coupling (coordinators don't need to know about each other's implementations)
- Follows standard iOS patterns that developers are familiar with
- Prevents circular dependencies between coordinators

## Factory Pattern Integration

The example integrates the Factory pattern with coordinators:

```swift
func rootViewController() -> UIViewController {
    let authentication = WelcomeViewFactory.create()
    authentication.delegate = self
    return authentication
}
```

This combination:

- Further separates responsibilities (factories create view controllers, coordinators manage navigation)
- Makes view controller creation consistent and centralized
- Makes it easier to inject dependencies into view controllers
- Improves testability of both coordinators and view controllers

## Best Practices for Implementing Coordinators

Based on the Unsplash app example, here are best practices for implementing the Coordinator pattern:

1. **Use delegation for communication**: Establish clear protocols for coordinator communication
2. **Keep coordinators focused**: Each coordinator should handle a specific flow or section of the app
3. **Use weak references for delegates**: Prevent memory leaks with proper reference management
4. **Combine with Factory pattern**: Use factories to create and configure view controllers
5. **Pass only what's needed**: Only pass navigation controllers or data that coordinators need
6. **Handle navigation logic exclusively in coordinators**: Never let view controllers perform navigation
7. **Structure hierarchically**: Organize coordinators in a hierarchy that mirrors your app's structure
8. **Use appropriate navigation techniques**: Different flows might require different navigation approaches (push, present, etc.)

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Memory Management

Challenge: Potential for retain cycles between coordinators and view controllers.

Solution in the example:

```swift
weak var delegate: AuthenticationCoordinatorDelegate?
```

Always use weak references for delegates to prevent memory leaks.

### Navigation Control

Challenge: Multiple navigation controllers in complex UIs like tab bars.

Solution in the example:

```swift
func openPictureDetails(picture: PictureModel, _ navigationController: UINavigationController) {
    // Navigation logic using the passed navigationController
}
```

Pass the specific navigation controller to coordinator methods when handling navigation within tabs.

### Coordinator Lifecycle

Challenge: Managing the lifecycle of child coordinators.

Solution: The parent coordinator maintains strong references to child coordinators and is responsible for their lifecycle.

```swift
let authenticationCoordinator: AuthenticationCoordinator
let browseCoordinator: BrowseCoordinator
```

## Practical Implementation for Homework Assignment

For implementing navigation from Sign In to Sign Up, here's how to apply the Coordinator pattern:

1. **Create a coordinator protocol**:

```swift
protocol Coordinator: AnyObject {
    func start()
}
```

2. **Implement an AuthCoordinator**:

```swift
class AuthCoordinator: Coordinator {
    private let navigationController: UINavigationController

    init(navigationController: UINavigationController) {
        self.navigationController = navigationController
    }

    func start() {
        showSignIn()
    }

    func showSignIn() {
        let signInVC = SignInViewController()
        signInVC.delegate = self
        navigationController.setViewControllers([signInVC], animated: false)
    }

    func showSignUp() {
        let signUpVC = SignUpViewController()
        signUpVC.delegate = self
        navigationController.pushViewController(signUpVC, animated: true)
    }
}
```

3. **Implement View Controller delegates**:

```swift
extension AuthCoordinator: SignInViewControllerDelegate {
    func didTapSignUp() {
        showSignUp()
    }
}

extension AuthCoordinator: SignUpViewControllerDelegate {
    func didTapBack() {
        navigationController.popViewController(animated: true)
    }
}
```

4. **Set up in AppDelegate/SceneDelegate**:

```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene,
           willConnectTo session: UISceneSession,
           options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

    guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

    let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
    let navigationController = UINavigationController()

    let authCoordinator = AuthCoordinator(navigationController: navigationController)
    authCoordinator.start()

    window.rootViewController = navigationController
    window.makeKeyAndVisible()
    self.window = window
}
```

By following this implementation pattern, you will be able to successfully implement a coordinator that navigates between Sign In and Sign Up screens.
